# Ticket-plane-app
This was the project for my Visual Programming course, a ticket plane app which includes making a reservation and printing it in a text file.

The ticket ID increments by 1 as long as the app is running and resets back to 0 when the app is restarted.

The printed reservation will be inside the Bin>Debug Folder named "Ticket Reservation"
